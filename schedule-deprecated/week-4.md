# Week 4: Software Engineering and Frontend with React

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Day 16 - Proactive Frontend

### Application architecture and system analysis

- If you want to build a social network, a marketplace, a car-rental system, a restaurant booking platform, then you need to organize your code with a smart architecture

### React.js basics

- Why React?
- The main reasons and philosophy
- Installation and usage
- Building blocks of React, `react`, `reactDOM`
- Component and virtual DOM
- It's just JavaScript!
- vs jQuery, Vue, Angular, Preact, Web Components, Elm, etc
- Preparing your code editor (Atom, VS Code, Sublime, Vim, etc) with React plugins

### Component-based development

- Design planning with wireframe/mockup
- Parent and child relationship between components

### Rendering user interface (UI)

- Quickly create a new app with `create-react-app` CLI
- Creating components and writing HTML with `class` in JSX
- JSX is a DSL (Domain Specific Language) over JavaScript
- React DevTools for debugging

### React conventions

- Element naming
- Class-based components
- Stateless functional components

### Understanding state management and holding data

- Managing state in applications with `this`, `state`, `setState`, `getState`
- Passing data between components with with `props`, `propTypes`, and `defaultProps`
- Controlled components

### Event and bind handling

- Methods in component
- Fetching data from an AJAX endpoint
- Working with forms, retrieving data from DOM inputs

### Rendering with external data

- Complete lifecycle of a component
- Explore various lifecycle hooks
- Persisting data with `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` Virtual DOM

### Frontend deployment

- VPS or PaaS: Heroku, Now.sh, etc
- Process management with pm2

## Day 17 - Sophisticated Activation

### Routing with React Router

- Route and Link component
- Creating different routes/paths
- Use state to dynamically render different pages

### Asynchronous Programming

- Callback
- `Promise`
- `async`, `await`

### Functional Programming (FP)

- Data immutability
- Pure function/component
- Higher Order Component (HOC)

### Diagramming

- D3.js

### Project

- Content Management System (CMS)

### UI Components Library

- Reactstrap, Material UI

### Build system

- Webpack, Gulp, Grunt, Rollup, Broccoli
- `webpack-dev-server` for hot reloading
- ES+ with Babel

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Day 18 - Types and Tests

### Styling techniques

- Regular CSS, Flexbox, Stylus/LESS/SASS
- Inline styling, CSS in JS
- CSS modules
- BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)

### Static typing

- Flow static type checker
- vs PropTypes, TypeScript

### Frontend testing libraries

- Jest, Enzyme
- Snapshot testing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Day 19 - Power Control

### Better state management

- Flux vs Redux vs MobX
- Component state vs Redux state
- Intuition to determine when to use them
- It can be used with any other library than just React

### React + Redux

- Reducers
- Actions and Action Creators
- `createStore` to create a Redux store
- `react-redux` to connect React & Redux
- Data architecture normalization
- Better Redux store with combineReducers 
- Middleware
- Authentication when needed

### Additionals (if necessary)

- Redux architecture best practices and rules
- Redux + React Router
- `redux-saga`

### Advanced techniques

- Server side rendering (SSR), universal/isomorphic React
- Static site
- Optimize for SEO
- Next.js, Gatsby.js, etc

### Frontend testing

- Jest, Enzyme, etc
- Snapshot testing
- Continuous Integration (CI)
