# Ideation

## Pitching

The shorter and concise you pitch, the beter.
You may use your voice and your flare.
You may not use a computer, whiteboard, etc to break it down simply.

**What should you pitch?**

* Pitch something you would want to spend the remaining 2 weeks building.
* Pitch something you are willing to see evolve, because your original idea is usually not where the final product ends up. If the idea is more important than the process, don't pitch it.
* You're pitching to engineers, show and talk about something that will engage them. Cool technical problems are awesome and show your sophistication.

## Product Guidelines

You can build anything. Yes, anything. Though we suspect you'll want to start from the skills you've gained in the last 6 weeks. Don't let that be where you end.

When thinking about what you will build, consider the following:

* Successful product demonstrate engaged delivery within a team scenario, confidence in building a product using learned skills, the ability to stretch and incorporate skills not taught at the bootcamp.
* You know how to build CRUD apps, don't just build a simple CRUD app. Stretch! Build something you don't know how to build!
* Have a cool idea and build something meaningful, but recognize that polish and marketing is not your goal. The audience are devs and recruiters. They (mostly) don't give a crap about your "product" and it's goals. They (mostly) want to see the code, your process and your passion.

## Product Workflow

We recommend that you use good engineering practices.

* Build features in vertical slices (from design to implementation).
* Re-evaluate your user stories and product goal regularly. Don't be afraid to pivot from the original idea (though don't pivot too often).
* Develop team workflow agreements around git, deployment, testing, conflict resolution, breaks, and other important items.

What we want to provide.

* Support for team leads (and team members!) to help keep interpersonal conflict and friction at a minimum.
* Tips in constructing and advancing your debugging process.
* We will be available to consult with your team. Have questions ready for us. If you don't we will use those as free time to explore, mangle, or flog yourcode. Friday and Tuesday will be consultation days.

# Team Work

This is a short practical guide on why, how, and what to do during team work.

## Guide

### Why do we need a guide?

Quality application needs to be guided, to bring more extra attention to deliverables that can delight us from developers to the end users. That's why.

### How are we going to do it?

By following these objectives. That's how.

### What are the minimum objectives?

**Beginner Product**

* Taking attention to the main deliverables.
* Documenting the plan thoroughly before creating any code. It's highly recommended to write a README with proper Markdown syntaxes.
* Practicing agile methodology with Scrum and Kanban. Report the progress at least every 1 hour.
* Drafting some backlog and point of main features, then sort them out. For every major task, create an issue.
* Differentiating branches or even repos when separating our tasks. Forking the repo is even better approach.
* Architecting the app based on analysis that has been concluded by team.
* Creating a more-than-just-CRUD app, utilizing web api that connects server and client apps.
* Features: Documentation, Server and Client, HTTP + RESTful Web API, SQL or NoSQL Database, Auth with Session
* Tools: Git, Markdown, Atom, GitHub, ZenHub, cURL/Postman, Postico/Robomongo

**Intermediate Product**

* Employing the benefits of testing to make sure our application is stable.
* Use principles like single responsibility, loose coupling, and separation of concerns.
* Covering the app functionalities within isolated environment of test.
* Improving code quality with code review and analysis service. Improve your grade by following the suggestions.
* Bringing the app design to various device dimensions.
* Features: Modular, AJAX, File Upload, CSS Preprocessor, Responsive + Grid, Unit + API Testing, Auth with JWT
* Tools: jQuery, Mocha, Chai + chai-http, Axios/SuperAgent, Web Storage, Less/Stylus

**Advanced Product**

* Gettting Test-Driven Development (TDD) or Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) to work.
* Making sure the UI is behaving as expected.
* Expediting the development workflow to the most effective and efficient possible.
* Automating consistent testing with Continuous Integration that results whether the app is pass or broken.
* Versioning or even tagging the app properly.
* Features: TDD/BDD, UI Testing, Spies/Stubs/Mocks, Continuous Integration (CI)
* Tools: Selenium/Nightmare, Travis/Jenkins CI

## Specifics to Agile/Scrum/Kanban

* Must follow practices of Scrum or Kanban, preparation for the final product.
* Must divide the tasks/roles to each member in clear definition.
* Must arrange targets to super ultimate very mini small sprint per 1 hour.
* Must use artifact like backlog and story point. Even better, burndown chart.
* Must use board to visualize the progress better. We can use sticky notes, GitHub Projects, Trello, or other if needed.
