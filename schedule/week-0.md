# Week 0: The Web

Hello, learners! Welcome to the preparation of joining Impact Byte.

Here we provide you some inspirational things, readings, and courses that are very recommended to take before we start the actual class. The purpose of this preparation is to give you most of the initial idea about what we'll be learning through in the 1st week. Of course, in our class, there are a plenty more discussions, materials, and practices to learn from. It's still okay to not understand everything, but at least you will be more familiar with code. :)

To get you ready, we will have some easy tasks to do:
