Hi,

It's me Haidar from Impact Byte. Sure, I still remember it. :)
Thank you for waiting a bit longer than expected. I had to ultra focused on my work in the last few weeks.

Impact Byte (https://impactbyte.com) is a coding school with fast-track program to learn to code professionally onsite located in Jakarta, Indonesia. Essentially we will  transform beginners to be a profesional developer in just 8 weeks. The main goal is also to teach people to code their own digital products.

We are potentially would have a win-win partnership, for mutual exposure and attracting various people especially developers into us. For this initial initiation, we don't have to worry about serious terms. Let's see how it goes first if you're also interested. But if you have some conditions, I'd be happy to hear that.

So, would you like to have a partnership with Impact Byte as well?

Let me explain a bit about TribeHired. We are an online platform that help companies to find the right IT candidates. Essentially what we do is to select a number of awesome technical talent every week and we share their profile with top IT companies across South East Asia like: Line, Grab, Lazada, Uber, GO-JEK, HappyFresh etc.

Our HQ is in Malaysia, and now we are in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam as well.

I notice that you are currently looking for Senior Java Programmer.
Below is an "example" of talents profile in our platform:

It's totally free to become a strategic partner. We will recommend you to our graduates later on.

Yes, it's possible to have a meeting for next week, around 14-18 August, between 9 AM - 8 PM. Please find the attached pitch deck about Impact Byte profile too. Looking forward to your response as well, and our next cooperation.

Thanks and kind regards,
