Hello [NAME] and good [MORNING/AFTERNOON/EVENING],

I'm Haidar, the Program Lead of Impact Byte, an adventurous full stack developer and mentor. Yes, adventurous is a legitimate title. :)

[SHORT STORY]

[Impact Byte] will help you to...

> In my methodology which I called POA (Product-Oriented-Approach), you just need to learn what you need for real in form of a well-structured product with organized tasks.
> This approach is far better than just boring theory of coding which leads you to nowhere. You know what, the advantages of this approach are:

- LESS time.
- MINIMUM tech stacks.
- Product FOCUS.
- KEY PRINCIPLES that help you transform your business ideas into an app which can be monitized eventually.

Learning this way, it will get you something REAL quickly and efficiently, especially for Entrepreneur and Founders

If you wouldn’t mind, I’d love it if you answered one quick question: Why did you sign up for Impact Byte?

I’m asking because knowing what made you sign up is really helpful for me in making sure that I am delivering on what my students want. Just hit “reply” and let us know.

Also, it'd be such a huge help if you could share Impact Byte with your friends and colleagues. :)
