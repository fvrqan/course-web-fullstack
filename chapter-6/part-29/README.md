# Static Typing

Flow static type checker

Type checking vs PropTypes vs TypeScript

* [Typechecking With PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html)

# React Testing

Jest built by Facebook, is a complete JavaScript testing solution. It works with and without React. Jest is used by Facebook, Oculus, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, The New York Times, and more. It also [works in TypeScript](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest).

While Enzyme built by Airbnb, is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components' output.

Jest is more for unit or functional testing, Enzyme is more for visual regression testing.

We can also use them with other testing libraries.

# Redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
It is a better state management solution when we have a lot of state in our app.

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.
You can use Redux by its own, together with React, or with any other view library.

React's Component state vs Redux store differs in how they're located and managed. Traditional state is located in each components, while store is located in the outest root component but accessible to any components inside.
Redux is an easier alternative for Flux, the application architecture that Facebook uses for building client-side web applications.

There's also some alternatives called React's Context API, Flux, MobX, etc.

## React's Context API

React has its own solution to manage complex state, called `Context`.
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

## React & Redux

To integrate Redux into React, there's [`react-redux`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux), the official React bindings for Redux.
