## React Native

React Native is one of the most popular mobile app development library to build Android or iOS app.

React Native vs NativeScript, Weex, Flutter, Ionic, PhoneGap, Cordova.

To start learning React Native, we can use:

* [`create-react-native-app`](https://npm.im/create-react-native-app) installer
* [Expo](https://expo.io) with its [development tools](https://expo.io/tools) to run our app via the web. So we don't need to use a mobile device directly at the beginning.
  * We have to install the Expo client on either [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779).

```sh
npm install -g create-react-native-app

create-react-native-app example

cd example

npm start

npm run android

npm run ios
```
