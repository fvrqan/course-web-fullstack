## Developer Mindset

* Developer is a person who has competent knowledge on technical skills and issues, who understands what design pattern means, knows how to design a database schema, or to inspect an HTTP REST API request, and who can learn a new programming language or techniques quickly
* Strive for a good way of building tech products. Write your MVP's stories, draw your data structure scheme, build a mockup, collaborate on Github

* Do mindfulness sessions periodically
* Speed up your typing and workflow skill that can make your more productive
* Practice, practice, practice. Study and practice
* It's safe to fail fast and learn from your mistakes
* Problem solving, rather than just coding
* No pain, no gain
* Get into the flow
* English all the way
* Growth mindset
