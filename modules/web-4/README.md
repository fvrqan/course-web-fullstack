## How to Improve Web Performance

* Reduce HTTP Request

Every fetched resource with either a HTTP or HTTPS web address decreases speed, which means: the fewer the number of requests, the better your website will perform. You can speed up your website by simplifying the design and coding elements. 

* Reduce Image Size

When using images in the sites google doesn't recommend png format use webp/jpeg/jpeg xr.

Use images whenever required compress the images before shipping it to the Production.Crop the images to the required width/height 
check on chrome dev tools it shows the required width/height. Also, you can adopt new image formats, such as WebP and JPeg XR, can also help reduce image weight by 20 to 50 percent without sacrificing quality.

* Use CDN

Content delivery networks (CDN) are the transparent backbone of the Internet in charge of content delivery. To minimize the distance between the visitors and your website’s server, a CDN stores a cached version of its content in multiple geographical locations (a.k.a., points of presence, or PoPs).

* Optimize CSS and JavaScript

Writing clean and well-structured CSS code is crucial for performance because poorly written CSS will increase page loading time which leads to an inferior user experience.

* Minify resources

“Minify” is a verb from programming jargon that means removing undesired code from a CSS or JavaScript file. Minifying code is an excellent way to improve web page performance. If your code contains extra white spaces, page breaks, and line breaks, remove these elements to enhance website performance.
