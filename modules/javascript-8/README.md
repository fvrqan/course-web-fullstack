## Pattern Matching

Pattern Matching in programming is often associated with Regular Expression (regex).

Pattern matching or recognition is useful to be used when checking a text format like phone number, email address, zip code, etc.

In JavaScript, there are built-in regex methods: `replace`, `match`, `search`.
