## How would you do things?

Let's evaluate on how we think and do things in the real world.

For example, how would you do these activities?

* Walking to your school
* Cooking a lunch meal
* Fixing a broken thing

Remember that in anywhere, you are getting paid to solve problems using your logic and collective team discussion. Coding is just the tool you use to solve them.
