## NodeJs

### What is NodeJs

NodeJs is a open source JavaScript runtime environment. Using NodeJs we can execute javascript code outside of a browser.

### Install NodeJs

[Install via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) or via [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation).

### Node REPL

REPL stands for Read Eval Print Loop and it represents a computer environment like a Windows console or Unix/Linux shell.

Start REPL by using node command

```sh
node
```

```sh
# node command list
ctrl + c − terminate the current command.
ctrl + c twice − terminate the Node REPL.
ctrl + d − terminate the Node REPL.
Up/Down Keys − see command history and modify previous commands.
tab Keys − list of current commands.
.help − list of all commands.
.break − exit from multiline expression.
.clear − exit from multiline expression.
.save filename − save the current Node REPL session to a file.
.load filename − load file content in current Node REPL session.
```

you can also execute a javascript file.

```sh
node index.js
```

## NPM (Node Package Manager)

NPM is distributed with NodeJs - which means that when you download NodeJs, you automatically get NPM installed on your computer. NPM is a package manager for Node.js packages, or modules if you like.

### NPM Commands

```zsh
# install npm package globally
npm install -g nodemon
# setup new npm package
npm init
# setup new npm package without any question
npm init -y
# install package and save to package dependency
npm install express --save
# install package and save to development package dependency
npm install pretty-error --save-dev
# install package dependency on production mode
npm install --production
# run a project
npm start
npm run dev
```

After `npm install` command, NPM will create node_modules folder in your project, dont forget to add node_modules folder to your .gitignore file.

### package.json

The `npm init` command will generate package.json, this file holds various information relevant to the project.

```js
{
  "name": "api-project-3",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon index.js",
    "build" "echo \"build\" "
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "cors": "^2.8.4",
    "dotenv": "^6.0.0",
    "express": "^4.16.3",
    "morgan": "^1.9.0",
    "mysql2": "^1.5.3",
    "sequelize": "^4.38.0"
  }
}
```

The `scripts` part is a collections of command list to run the project.

```sh
# run start script
npm start
# run another script besides start script
npm run dev
npm run test
```

### package-lock.json

The package-lock.json help you to ensure a consistent install and compatible dependencies.

## Project Environment

Software code is usually developed, tested, and ultimately made available to end users in different computing environments.

- Dev Environment
  Development environments are either local or remote environments that are meant for a programmer to write, test, and optimize code before it’s deployed into a real-world live situation.

- Prod Environment
  The production environment is where the software runs constantly and is widely available to end users and/or other software.

For separating global variable in diffrent enviroment we can use `.env` file

```
APP_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=homestead
DB_USERNAME=homestead
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

### Semantic versioning

SemVer is a 3-component system in the format of `x.y.z` where:

1. `x` stands for a major version
2. `y` stands for a minor version
3. `z` stands for a patch

A change in patch represents a bugfix that doesn’t break anything. A change in minor version represents a new functionality that doesn’t break anything. A change in major version represents a large change that breaks compatibility. If users don’t adapt to a major version change, stuff won’t work.

Always start at `0.1.0` and before `1.0.0` is only the development phase.
