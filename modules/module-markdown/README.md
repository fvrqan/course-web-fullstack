# Markdown

---

Markdown is one of the best way to create a notes or documentation about anything. Yes, anything!

It's a text format that usually has `.md` or `.markdown` file extension.

For example, we can type in:

```md
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3
```

to create this:

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

## Heading 3

Some common tricks is to bold or italic some text:

```md
**bold** and _italic_
```

like so:

**bold** and _italic_

There's even a way to automatically create some bullet lists:

```md
* First
* Second
* Third

or

1.  One
2.  Two
3.  Three
```

like so:

* First
* Second
* Third

or

1.  One
2.  Two
3.  Three

Links also work:

```md
[Google](https://google.com)
```

like so:

[Google](https://google.com)
