# Final Team Work

## Pitching

Pitches are 1-3 minutes. You may use your voice and your flare. You may not use a computer, whiteboard, etc.

**What should you pitch? See Product Guidelines Below**

- Pitch something you would want to spend the remaining 2 weeks building.
- Pitch something you are willing to see evolve, because your original idea is usually not where the final product ends up. If the idea is more important than the process, don't pitch it.
- You're pitching to engineers, show and talk about something that will engage them. Cool technical problems are awesome and show your sophistication.

## Product Guidelines

You can build anything. Yes, anything. Though we suspect you'll want to start from the skills you've gained in the last 6 weeks. Don't let that be where you end.

When thinking about what you will build, consider the following:

- Successful product demonstrate engaged delivery within a team scenario, confidence in building a product using learned skills, the ability to stretch and incorporate skills not taught at the bootcamp.
- You know how to build CRUD apps, don't just build a simple CRUD app. Stretch! Build something you don't know how to build!
- Have a cool idea and build something meaningful, but recognize that polish and marketing is not your goal. The audience are devs and recruiters. They (mostly) don't give a crap about your "product" and it's goals. They (mostly) want to see the code, your process and your passion.

## Product Workflow

We recommend that you use Agile engineering practices.

- Build features in vertical slices (from test to css).
- Re-evaluate your user stories and product goal regularly. Don't be afraid to pivot from the original idea (though don't pivot too often).
- Develop team workflow agreements around git, deployment, testing, conflict resolution, breaks, and other important items.

What we want to provide.

- Support for team leads (and team members!) to help keep interpersonal conflict and friction at a minimum.
- Tips in constructing and advancing your debugging process.
- We will be available to consult with your team. Have questions ready for us. If you don't we will use those as free time to explore, mangle, or flog yourcode. Friday and Tuesday will be consultation days.
